# cidrly Beta Testing Guide

Welcome to the cidrly beta program! Thank you for helping us test and improve this network architecture planning tool.

## What is cidrly?

cidrly is a modern, interactive CLI tool that helps network engineers plan and design network architectures with:

- ðŸŽ¨ **Interactive Dashboard** - Beautiful React-based terminal interface
- ðŸ“Š **VLSM Optimization** - Automatic subnet calculations with zero address gaps
- ðŸ“ˆ **Dual Efficiency Metrics** - Supernet fit and address packing efficiency
- ðŸ”¢ **Smart Planning** - 50% capacity rule for future growth
- ðŸ’¾ **Save/Load Plans** - JSON-based network plan persistence
- ðŸ”’ **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript with Zod validation

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS/Linux) - Recommended

```bash
# Tap the cidrly repository
brew tap chuckycastle/cidrly

# Install cidrly
brew install cidrly

# Run cidrly
cidrly
```

### Option 2: NPM (All Platforms)

```bash
# Install globally with beta tag
npm install -g cidrly@beta

# Run cidrly
cidrly
```

### Option 3: From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chuckycastle/cidrly.git
cd cidrly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and run
npm run build
npm start
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the dashboard:**

   ```bash
   cidrly
   ```

2. **Create your first network plan:**
   - Press `n` to create a new plan
   - Enter a plan name (e.g., "Campus Network")
   - Enter a base IP address (e.g., "10.0.0.0")

3. **Add subnets:**
   - Press `a` to add a subnet
   - Enter subnet name (e.g., "Engineering")
   - Enter VLAN ID (e.g., 10)
   - Enter expected device count (e.g., 25)
   - cidrly automatically plans for 50 devices (2x expected)

4. **Calculate network plan:**
   - Press `c` to calculate IP ranges
   - View optimized VLSM allocation with dual efficiency metrics

5. **Save your plan:**
   - Press `s` to save
   - Plans are saved as JSON in `saved-plans/`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key            | Action                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `â†‘/â†“` or `k/j` | Navigate subnets       |
| `i` or `Enter` | Show subnet details    |
| `a`            | Add new subnet         |
| `e`            | Edit selected subnet   |
| `x`            | Delete selected subnet |
| `c`            | Calculate network plan |
| `s`            | Save plan to file      |
| `l`            | Load plan from file    |
| `b`            | Change base IP address |
| `q`            | Quit dashboard         |
| `Esc`          | Cancel current dialog  |

## Example Network Plans

Check the `examples/` directory for sample network plans:

- `campus-network.json` - Multi-building campus with VLANs
- `data-center.json` - Server infrastructure with multiple tiers
- `branch-office.json` - Small office network

Load an example with `l` and select from the file picker.

## What to Test

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Create new network plans with different base IPs
- [ ] Add multiple subnets with varying device counts
- [ ] Calculate network plans and verify IP ranges
- [ ] Edit existing subnets and recalculate
- [ ] Delete subnets and verify plan updates
- [ ] Save and load network plans
- [ ] View detailed subnet information

### UI/UX

- [ ] Navigate with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Check readability on your terminal (light/dark themes)
- [ ] Test with different terminal sizes
- [ ] Verify error messages are helpful
- [ ] Check that dialogs work properly

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Very large device counts (1000+)
- [ ] Very small device counts (1-2)
- [ ] Maximum VLAN ID (4094)
- [ ] Invalid inputs (letters where numbers expected)
- [ ] Loading corrupted/invalid JSON files
- [ ] Disk space errors when saving

## Known Limitations

This is a **beta release** with the following known limitations:

- âœ… IPv4 only (IPv6 support planned)
- âœ… JSON export only (CSV/YAML planned)
- âœ… No network visualization (diagrams planned)
- âœ… No import from existing configs (planned)
- âœ… Limited error recovery in some scenarios

### Common Issues

**Q: Command not found after installation**

A: Make sure your PATH includes npm global bin:

```bash
# For npm installation
npm config get prefix  # Should be in your PATH

# For Homebrew installation
brew doctor  # Check for PATH issues
```

**Q: Dashboard not rendering correctly**

A: Try a different terminal or check your terminal color settings. cidrly works best with:

- 256-color support
- Unicode support
- Minimum 80x24 terminal size

**Q: Can't save/load plans**

A: Check that you have write permissions in the current directory or use the `saved-plans/` directory.
