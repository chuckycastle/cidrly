# AI Development Rules for cidrly

## Purpose

This document establishes **mandatory rules** for AI assistants (like Claude Code) working on this project. These rules are **non-negotiable** and must be followed in every development session.

## üö® CRITICAL: Pre-Push Verification is MANDATORY

### Rule #1: Always Install the Pre-Push Hook First

When starting a new development session, **IMMEDIATELY check if the pre-push hook is installed:**

```bash
# Check if hook exists
test -f .git/hooks/pre-push && echo "‚úì Hook installed" || echo "‚úó Hook missing"

# If missing, install it
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

**Why:** The hook prevents CI failures by catching issues locally. Without it, you WILL break the build.

### Rule #2: Never Push Without Verification

Before **EVERY** `git push`, the verification script MUST run. The pre-push hook does this automatically, but if you need to verify manually:

```bash
./scripts/verify-pre-push.sh
```

**If this script fails, you MUST fix the issues before pushing. No exceptions.**

### Rule #3: Never Use `git push --no-verify`

Using `--no-verify` is **FORBIDDEN** except in documented emergencies.

**Valid emergencies only:**

- Production is down and hotfix is critical
- CI infrastructure itself is broken (not your code)

**ALWAYS document in commit message if you bypass the hook.**

### Rule #4: Fix Failures Locally, Not in CI

If verification fails:

1. ‚ùå **WRONG:** "I'll push and fix it when CI fails"
2. ‚úÖ **RIGHT:** "I'll fix it now and verify locally"

**Remember:** Local feedback is instant. CI feedback takes minutes and wastes resources.

## Mandatory Verification Checklist

Before pushing ANY code, ensure these pass:

- [ ] ESLint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Prettier formatting correct (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Security scan passes (`npm run security`)
- [ ] Production build works (`npm run build:prod`)

**The pre-push hook checks all of these automatically.**

## Code Quality Rules

### Rule #5: Always Run Format Before Committing

```bash
# Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run format

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Then commit
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
```

**Never commit code that fails `npm run format:check`.**

### Rule #6: Never Modify package.json Without Testing

If you modify `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, or dependencies:

1. Run `npm install` to update lockfile
2. Run `npm test` to verify tests still pass
3. Run `./scripts/verify-pre-push.sh` before committing

### Rule #7: Test Coverage Must Not Decrease

Current coverage thresholds (in `jest.config.mjs`):

- Branches: 69%
- Functions: 64%
- Lines: 71%
- Statements: 71%

**Never lower these thresholds without explicit approval.**

If you add new code that lowers coverage, **add tests** to maintain thresholds.

## Development Workflow Rules

### Rule #8: Follow the Correct Git Workflow

**For regular changes:**

```bash
# 1. Make changes
# 2. Format and lint
npm run format
npm run lint:fix

# 3. Test
npm test

# 4. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"

# 5. Push (hook runs automatically)
git push origin main
```

**For version releases:**

```bash
# 1. Verify everything passes
./scripts/verify-pre-push.sh

# 2. Push changes first
git push origin main

# 3. Bump version
npm version patch  # or minor

# 4. Push tag (hook runs again)
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

### Rule #9: Never Skip Steps in the Publishing Workflow

See CLAUDE.md "Publishing Updates to NPM" section. Follow it **exactly**.

**Never:**

- Run `npm publish` locally (use GitHub Actions)
- Skip version bumping
- Push without tags
- Forget to update CHANGELOG.md

### Rule #10: Always Update Documentation

When adding features or changing behavior:

- [ ] Update README.md if user-facing
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if development process changes
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md if architecture changes
- [ ] Update type definitions if TypeScript changes

**Documentation is part of the feature. Not optional.**

## Code Style Rules

### Rule #11: Follow TypeScript Strict Mode

- All code must compile with `strict: true`
- No `any` types without justification (use `unknown` instead)
- No `@ts-ignore` without documented reason
- All functions must have return types (ESLint enforces this)

### Rule #12: Follow Existing Patterns

- UI components: Use Ink patterns from existing components
- State management: Use Zustand with Immer (see `src/store/`)
- Validation: Use Zod schemas (see `src/schemas/`)
- File operations: Use FileService (see `src/services/`)

**Don't introduce new patterns without discussion.**

### Rule #13: Security First

- Always validate user input with Zod
- Always sanitize file paths (use `security-utils.ts`)
- Never trust external data
- Never bypass security checks

**Security utils are mandatory for:**

- File path handling (`sanitizeFilePath`, `resolveUserPath`)
- Filename validation (`validateFilename`)
- Path safety checks (`isPathSafe`)

## Testing Rules

### Rule #14: Write Tests for New Code

- New features require tests
- Bug fixes require regression tests
- Tests must pass before committing

**Test file location:** `tests/` directory or next to source file with `.test.ts` extension

### Rule #15: Use Correct Test Patterns

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should do expected behavior', () => {
    const result = functionUnderTest();
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    expect(() => functionUnderTest(invalidInput)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## Problem-Solving Rules

### Rule #16: Simple Solutions First

**Always** read `.claude/PROBLEM_SOLVING_PRINCIPLES.md` before starting complex work.

**Key principle:**

- Ask "Can we just not do X?" before "How can we work around X?"
- Prefer removing problems over solving them
- Choose solution that touches fewest files
- Value maintainability over technical elegance

**If you're modifying >5 files for a UI issue, you're probably over-engineering.**

### Rule #17: No Clever Code

- Write obvious code
- Use clear variable names
- Prefer verbosity over brevity
- Comment "why," not "what"

**Bad:** `const x = a.reduce((p,c) => p + c.v, 0)`

**Good:**

```typescript
// Calculate total value from all items
const totalValue = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.value, 0);
```

## Communication Rules

### Rule #18: Be Explicit About Changes

When making changes, clearly state:

1. What files are being modified
2. Why the change is necessary
3. What the expected outcome is
4. Any risks or tradeoffs

**Don't make silent changes. Always explain your reasoning.**

### Rule #19: Warn About Breaking Changes

If a change might break existing functionality:

1. **STOP** and explain the risk
2. Ask for confirmation
3. Document the breaking change in CHANGELOG.md
4. Update version appropriately (minor bump in 0.x.x)

## Emergency Procedures

### Rule #20: What to Do If CI Fails

If you push and CI fails:

1. **Don't panic** - Check the CI logs
2. **Reproduce locally** - Run the failing check
3. **Fix locally** - Don't try to fix in CI
4. **Verify** - Run `./scripts/verify-pre-push.sh`
5. **Push fix** - Commit and push (hook will verify)

**Common CI failures:**

- Formatting: Run `npm run format`
- Lint: Run `npm run lint:fix`
- Tests: Run `npm test` and fix failing tests
- Build: Run `npm run build:prod` and fix TypeScript errors

### Rule #21: What to Do If Hook is Blocking You

If the pre-push hook blocks your push:

1. **Read the error message** - It tells you exactly what failed
2. **Fix the issue** - Don't bypass, fix it
3. **Verify manually** - Run `./scripts/verify-pre-push.sh`
4. **Push again** - Hook will allow it if checks pass

**Never use `--no-verify` to "fix" this. Fix the actual issue.**

## AI Assistant Specific Rules

### Rule #22: Always Verify Your Own Changes

Before telling the user "done," you must:

1. Run verification script
2. Check that all tests pass
3. Verify build succeeds
4. Confirm formatting is correct

**Don't assume. Verify.**

### Rule #23: Read Existing Documentation First

Before answering questions or making changes:

1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Read .claude/PROBLEM_SOLVING_PRINCIPLES.md
3. Check ARCHITECTURE.md if relevant
4. Review existing code patterns

**Don't guess. Read and understand first.**

### Rule #24: When in Doubt, Ask

If you're unsure about:

- Architectural decisions
- Breaking changes
- Version bumping strategy
- Security implications

**Ask the user first. Don't make assumptions.**

### Rule #25: Track Your Work

Use the TodoWrite tool to:

- Plan multi-step tasks
- Track progress
- Show completion status

**Users appreciate knowing what you're doing and what's left.**

## Summary: The Non-Negotiable Rules

1. ‚úÖ Install pre-push hook first thing
2. ‚úÖ Never bypass the hook (no `--no-verify`)
3. ‚úÖ Fix failures locally, not in CI
4. ‚úÖ Run format/lint before committing
5. ‚úÖ Run full verification before pushing
6. ‚úÖ Test all changes
7. ‚úÖ Update documentation
8. ‚úÖ Follow TypeScript strict mode
9. ‚úÖ Use existing patterns
10. ‚úÖ Security first, always

**Break these rules, break the build. Follow them, ship quality code.**

## Consequences of Breaking Rules

### If You Push Without Verification:

- ‚ùå CI will fail
- ‚ùå Build status becomes red
- ‚ùå Wastes CI minutes
- ‚ùå Delays development
- ‚ùå Frustrates team

### If You Follow All Rules:

- ‚úÖ CI always passes
- ‚úÖ Code quality stays high
- ‚úÖ Development moves fast
- ‚úÖ No surprises
- ‚úÖ Happy team

## Remember

**These rules exist because they've been broken before, and it caused problems.**

**Every rule in this document is based on a real mistake that wasted real time.**

**Follow the rules. Ship quality code. Make users happy.**
