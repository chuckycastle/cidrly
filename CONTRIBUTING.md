## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, questions, and documentation improvements.

### Bug Reports

Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/chuckycastle/cidrly/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) and include:

- Clear description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (cidrly version, Node.js version, OS)
- Error logs or terminal output
- Network plan details if relevant (sanitized)

### Feature Requests

Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/chuckycastle/cidrly/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) and describe:

- The feature you'd like to see

- Help with configuration

### Documentation

Use the [Documentation template](https://github.com/chuckycastle/cidrly/issues/new?template=documentation.yml) to suggest:

- Missing documentation
- Unclear explanations
- Examples that would be helpful
- Corrections to existing docs

## Contributing Code

### Finding Work

Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Maintainers need help with these
- `bug` - Bug fixes are always welcome
- `enhancement` - New features or improvements

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone might already be working on it
2. **Comment on the issue** - Let others know you're working on it
3. **Discuss major changes** - Open an issue first for significant changes

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/subnet-pool-management` - New features
- `fix/cidr-validation-bug` - Bug fixes
- `docs/api-examples` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/subnet-calculator` - Code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Add tests**
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Update existing tests if behavior changes
   - Ensure all tests pass

4. **Run the linter**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Format your code**

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `__tests__/` directories
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('SubnetCalculator', () => {
  it('should calculate correct subnet mask for /24 network', () => {
    // Arrange
    const calculator = new SubnetCalculator();

    // Act
    const result = calculator.calculateSubnetMask('192.168.1.0/24');

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('255.255.255.0');
  });
});
```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style.

### Key Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use strict type checking
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Naming**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and types
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### Running Formatters

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
npm run format
```

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages following these guidelines:

### Format

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of the change (optional).

Fixes #123
```

### Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

### Examples
